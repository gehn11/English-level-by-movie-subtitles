# English-level-by-movie-subtitles

Watching films in the original language is a popular and effective method of improving your foreign language skills. It is important to choose a film that suits the student's level of difficulty. In order to meet this condition, the teacher must watch the film and decide what level it corresponds to. However, this is time consuming.

The purpose of this project is to develop an ML solution to automatically determine the level of difficulty of English-language movies.
